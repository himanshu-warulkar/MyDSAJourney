/*Full Binary Tree: 0 or 2 children
 *Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
 *Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
 *Balanced Binary Tree: The height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
 *Skewed Binary Tree: All nodes have only one child (either left or right).
 *Binary Search Tree (BST): For each node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
 *AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees is at most one for all nodes.
 *Red-Black Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree with an additional property that ensures the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.
 *B-tree: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
 *N-ary Tree: A tree where each node can have at most N children.
 *Trie: A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings.
 *Segment Tree: A binary tree used for storing intervals or segments, allowing efficient querying of segment information.
 *Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree): A data structure that provides efficient methods for querying and updating the prefix sums of an array.
 *Suffix Tree: A compressed trie containing all the suffixes of a given string, used for fast substring searching.
 *Suffix Array: A sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, used for fast substring searching.
 *K-D Tree: A space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space, often used for nearest neighbor searches.
 *Quad Tree: A tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children, used for partitioning a two-dimensional space.
 *Octree: A tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children, used for partitioning a three-dimensional space.
