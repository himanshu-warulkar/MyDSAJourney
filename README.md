## **Overview**
The primary goal of this repository is to document my practice and progress in solving DSA problems. The problems focus on concepts such as arrays, recursion, sorting algorithms, binary search, and string manipulation. This repository is a work in progress and will grow as I continue learning and solving more problems.

## **Folder Structure**
The repository is organized into folders based on DSA topics:

1. **2D Array**  
   - Contains problems related to multi-dimensional arrays, such as matrix operations.
   
2. **Array**  
   - Covers fundamental operations like searching, updating, and manipulating arrays.

3. **Recursion**  
   - Includes problems solved using recursive approaches, demonstrating backtracking and divide-and-conquer techniques.

4. **Searching/Binary Search**  
   - Focuses on binary search and other efficient search techniques.

5. **Sorting**  
   - Implements sorting algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

6. **String**  
   - Deals with string manipulation problems, including pattern matching and character frequency.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with extensions for efficient debugging and development.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aiprogrammer2305/MyDSAJourney.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant folder for the topic you're interested in.
3. Open the source code file (`.cpp`) in your preferred editor or IDE.
4. Compile and run the code:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```
